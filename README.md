<h1>WAR! The Card Game</h1>

<h2>This is my rendition of the classic card game WAR!</h2>

<h3>I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the game from scratch and deploy it for users to test and experience <a href = "https://bcstidd.github.io/WAR/">Here!</a></h3>
<h2><strong><u>How to Play:</u></strong></h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Click the red button labeled 'New Game' under the title of WAR.</li>
    <p>This will render functions that generate the deck of cards, shuffle the deck, and deal 26 cards to both players.</p>
    <div><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/66H2f1F.png"></div>
    <li>Next, click the black 'Draw!' button located between the two player hands. This will prompt the browser to place down one random card from their hand, face up.
        <ul><li>The two cards' values are compared and whoever placed down the higher value card, retains <strong><i>both</i></strong> cards to their hand.</li></ul> </li>

    <li>If a player runs out of cards in their hand, they lose.</li>
    <li>In the event that both players play a card with equal value, the &nbsp <strong><i><u>!--WAR--!</u></i></strong> &nbsp begins!
        <ul><li>Traditionally, each player puts 3 cards from their hand face down and a fourth card face up. Whichever of the two 4th cards has higher value wins and the player retains ALL 8 CARDS.</li></ul></li>
        <ul>
    <li>This version of War, however, plays against the CPU. (She cheats!)</li></ul>
</ol>

<br></br>
When there is a tie, the player is the only one who plays 4 cards and the computer always wins, retaining all cards played.

When a player reaches a score of 0, the game ends and the other player claims the victory!
